This project explores clinical and demographic predictors of heart attack outcomes using statistical learning. With a dataset of 1,319 patients, it analyzes the influence of troponin levels, glucose, blood pressure, and age. Logistic regression models were applied to identify significant predictors, revealing troponin, age, and KCM as strong indicators of positive outcomes. The project highlights correlations, model findings, and data-driven insights for risk assessment.
