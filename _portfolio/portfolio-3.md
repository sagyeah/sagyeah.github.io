This project investigates body composition data for 436 individuals, focusing on body fat percentage as the target variable. Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, and Lasso Regression were compared to evaluate predictive accuracy and interpretability. Lasso Regression provided the strongest balance, identifying abdomen, sex, height, and wrist as key predictors of body fat percentage. The analysis demonstrates the trade-offs between different modeling approaches and emphasizes the value of penalized regression in health analytics:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
