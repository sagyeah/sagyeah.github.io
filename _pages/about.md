I was born and raised in Ghana, where I developed a love for problem solving early on  whether it was breaking down math puzzles or trying to make sense of everyday challenges with numbers. That curiosity led me to study Mathematics at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana, where I earned my BSc in Mathematics. My studies there laid the foundation for my current pursuit of a master’s degree in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science at North Carolina A&T State University (NCAT).

Along the way, I worked as a Data Analyst at Ghana Commercial Bank, where I learned first hand how data shapes financial decision making. Now, as both a Graduate Research Assistant and Teaching Assistant, I balance research on AI integration with guiding undergraduates in statistics.

What drives me is clarity and fairness in data driven decisions. I’m especially passionate about using machine learning, simulation, and explainable AI to tackle problems in finance, healthcare, and education fields that directly impact people’s lives.

Outside of academics and research, I enjoy football, content creation, and music. These interests keep me balanced and remind me that creativity, discipline, and connection are just as important as technical skills.

My long term goal is to bridge the gap between advanced analytics and real world decision making, ensuring technology serves people with transparency, fairness, and accountability.
