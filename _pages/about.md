Hi! I'm **Stephen Agyeah**, a master's student in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science at **North Carolina A&T State University**. I currently serve as a **Graduate Teaching Assistant**, guiding undergraduates in statistics and statistical programming with R.

Previously, I worked as a **Data Analyst** at Ghana Commercial Bank, where I used tools like R, SQL, and Python to clean data, build insights, and improve operational performance. I'm also passionate about **data visualization, simulation, and machine learning**.

My academic and professional journey has fueled a strong interest in **machine learning**, particularly in its applications to health, finance, and education. I'm especially passionate about **predictive modeling, simulation, and data visualization**, and always looking for new opportunities to deepen my skills in **ML and statistical computing**.
