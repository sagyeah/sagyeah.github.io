Hi! I’m Stephen Agyeah, a master’s student in Applied Mathematics with a concentration in Statistics and Data Science at North Carolina A&T State University. I currently serve as both a Graduate Research Assistant supporting research on AI integration in data science tasks and curriculum and a Graduate Teaching Assistant, guiding undergraduates in statistics and statistical programming with R.

Previously, I worked as a Data Analyst at Ghana Commercial Bank, where I applied tools such as R, SQL, and Python to clean data, build insights, and improve operational performance. These experiences strengthened my passion for data visualization, simulation, and machine learning as practical tools for solving real-world problems.

My academic and professional journey has fueled a deep interest in machine learning, particularly its applications in health, finance, and education. I am especially passionate about predictive modeling, simulation, and explainable AI, and I am always seeking opportunities to apply advanced statistical and computational methods to uncover insights and drive impact.

With a strong foundation in data science and a growing research portfolio, I aim to bridge the gap between rigorous analytics and practical decision making bringing clarity, fairness, and transparency to data-driven solutions.
